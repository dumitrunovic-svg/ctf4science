# CTF for Science Framework

Welcome to the **CTF for Science Framework**, a modular and extensible platform designed for benchmarking modeling methods on chaotic systems, from the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/). This framework supports the evaluation and comparison of models for systems like ordinary differential equations (ODEs, e.g., Lorenz system) and partial differential equations (PDEs, e.g., Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) using standardized datasets and metrics.

## Overview

The framework provides:
- A standardized environment for submitting and evaluating models.
- Predefined datasets and evaluation metrics.
- Tools for running models, saving results, and visualizing performance.

Whether you're a researcher benchmarking a new method or a contributor adding a model, this framework streamlines the process.

## 🔧 Quickstart 

Run a simple experiment on the Lorenz dataset with naive baselines:

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system
- Github account
- SSH key set up with GitHub (see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

### Clone the Repository
Using SSH (Recommended)
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:CTF-for-Science/ctf4science.git
```

Using HTTPS (requires GitHub authentication):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CTF-for-Science/ctf4science.git
```

### Install the Repository and run an example
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CTF-for-Science/ctf4science.git
cd ctf4science
pip install -e .
python models/CTF_NaiveBaselines/run.py models/CTF_NaiveBaselines/config/config_Lorenz_average_batch_all.yaml
```

Note that the `--recurse-submodules` flag will clone the associated model submodule repositories as well. If you don't want to download all submodules, and only want to run the CTF_NaiveBaselines, then you can run `git submodule update models/CTF_NaiveBaselines` after running `git clone https://github.com/CTF-for-Science/ctf4science.git`, and thereby circumvent cloning all the modules.

**Note**: This runs the 'average' baseline on the Lorenz dataset for sub-datasets 1 through 6. Results, including predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations (e.g., trajectory and histogram plots), are automatically saved in `results/ODE_Lorenz/CTF_NaiveBaselines_average/<batch_id>/`.

**Note**: To install optional dependencies, run `pip install -e .[all]` instead.

### 📁 Results Directory Structure

After a run, results are saved to:

```
results/<dataset>/<model>/<batch_id>/
  ├── <pair_id>/               # Metrics, predictions, and visualizations for each sub-dataset
  │   ├── config.yaml          # Configuration used
  │   ├── predictions.npy      # Predicted data
  │   ├── evaluation_results.yaml # Evaluation metrics
  │   └── visualizations/      # Auto-generated plots (e.g., trajectories.png)
  └── batch_results.yaml       # Aggregated batch metrics
```
